== Description ==

Customer Resource Management (CRM) comes in a variety of packages but nearly all the ones I have found come with a steep learning curve and installation can be tricky. That is why I have had written a CRM package for Wordpress. I wanted to create a plugin (easy to install), that would work with existing websites and would be easy to use.

The Wordpress CRM allows users to add clients, suppliers or opportunities. You have the ability to add notes to each client and also to assign reminders. You can sort by category (client, supplier, opportunity), and within this an extra field in opportunity allowing you to give each opportunity a value (ready to buy, looking for quotes, buying 6 months, first contact and no longer interested). These values will be listed when you sort by opportunities. You are also able to assign more than 1 address details or you can add a secondary contact to each record.

We are entering a further stage of development and hopefully will release an update shortly. This will have two additional features. Firstly, an integrated contacted form which will store data in the opportunities tab and allow for adding an additional configurable field (e.g. First contact, brochure request, etc). The second will allow user data to be included as part of the crm. Therefore, if you manage a site whereby contact with users is necessary you can now monitor that contact level.

== Installation ==

1. Copy "crm" folder to wordpress\wp-content\plugins\ directory.
2. Login in admin and click on Plugin > Installed.
3. Acrivate CRM plugin.
